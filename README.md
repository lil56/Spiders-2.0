# Spiders-2.0
This is the continuation of  TheCyberBrick's original mod, maintained and updated to the latest version of Minecraft Fabric. All previous features have been restored and some new ones added, with new development promised for the future on the opensource github profile!

A Minecraft mod that enhances the AI of spiders and their ability to climb.


## Features
Vanilla spiders are not yet creepy enough for you? You wish spiders would actually climb properly!
With Spiders 2.0 you dive into a world where intelligent arachnides crawl along walls and ceilings, finding their way around almost any obstacle to haunt you.
Combined with a Resource Pack like scarier spiders and a realistic shader, you can experience what one of the most feared animals can do in your favorite block game too.

*Spiders 2.0 needs to be installed on Server-Side too*
